Dependencies

   conversion to ReST syntax.

Compilers
=========

* c++11 compiler (listed version number has been tested at some point)

  * g++ >= GNU 4.8.5
  * icpc >= 2016

Executables
===========

* CMake >= 3.14
* Doxygen >= 1.8.5
* LaTeX >= 2017

Python Modules (for documentation)
==================================

* Sphinx >= 3.0.4
* Breathe >= 4.18.1
* sphinx\_rtd\_theme >= 0.4.3

For convenience, the minimal Python environment requirements for the
documentation build are included in ``environment.yaml`` and
``requirements.txt``. A minimal anaconda environment for building the
documentation can be created from an existing anaconda installation with the
following commands.

.. code:: bash

   $ conda env create --file environment.yaml

You can learn more about Anaconda Python environment creation and management in
the [Anaconda
Documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

C++ Libraries
=============

* eigen >= 3.3.7
* error\_tools: https://xcp-stash.lanl.gov/projects/MM/repos/error_tools
* vector\_tools: https://xcp-stash.lanl.gov/projects/MM/repos/vector_tools
* stress\_tools: https://xcp-stash.lanl.gov/projects/MM/repos/stress_tools
* solver\_tools: https://xcp-stash.lanl.gov/projects/MM/repos/solver_tools
* constitutive\_tools: https://xcp-stash.lanl.gov/projects/MM/repos/consitutive_tools

Constitutive Tools
------------------

All of the ``{error,vector,stress,solver,constitutive}_tools`` libraries are
pulled from their git repos by branch name and built with their respective cmake
files as part of the cmake build for this project.

Eigen
-----

https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen

Eigen must be "installed" following the ``eigen/INSTALL`` instructions. The
Eigen dependence is easiest to resolve if eigen is installed in the default
install directory.  However, if you don't have admin privileges, you can also
insall Eigen to your home directory in ``$HOME/.local/include`` or
``$HOME/include``.

Non-admin Eigen install
-----------------------

.. code:: bash

   # Create personal include file directory
   $ pwd
   /home/$USER
   $ mkdir -p .local/include
   # Move to repository directory
   $ cd /preferred/path/to/repos
   # Example
   $ pwd
   /projects/$USER/w13repos
   # Clone eigen
   $ git clone https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git
   $ cd eigen
   $ git checkout 3.3.7
   # Create build directory
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   # OPTIONAL. Set c++ compiler separate from system default
   $ export CXX=$(command -v g++)
   # Build eigen
   $ cmake3 .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local
   $ make install
